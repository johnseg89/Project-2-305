Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations by using the most current and effective software security. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? Performed static testing to uncover vulnerabilities. Coding securely can prevent data breaches that will lead to stolen client financial information. These breaches can damage a company's reputation and dependability. 


What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? I found that generating a checksum verification was the most challenging. I learned that the most current versions of software and libraries are extremely important to ensure the most effective defenses are used.


How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?	In my opinion Penetration testing is the most effective tool to understand vulnerabilities through the eyes of attackers.


How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? Running a second dependency check helped to provide a comparison to view any new vulnerabilities. Re-running code can help to ensure the code is running properly. 


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?	Oracle was a great resource that provided guides that were easy to understand.  

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? Successful usage of the Vulnerability Assessment diagram to find potential vulnerabilities.
